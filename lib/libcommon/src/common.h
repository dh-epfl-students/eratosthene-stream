     *  \section overview Overview
     *
     *  The _eratosthene-suite_ offers a front-end to the eratosthene indexation
     *  server implemented in the _liberatosthene_ library. It consists in a
     *  software suite offering front-end solutions to the functionalities of
     *  the eratosthene library.
     *
     *  The principal software implements the server itself, allowing to simply
     *  create server instances and to maintain network services. The suite also
     *  offers a front-end software for the data injection in server instances.
     *  It also offers a graphical 4D solution allowing to browse the 4D model
     *  of Earth offered by servers.
     *
     *  \section project Eratosthene Project
     *
     *  The Eratosthene Project was initially designed to address the challenge
     *  of very large point-based models of cities and environments. Indeed,
     *  mapping a whole city at the level of the centimeter induces very large
     *  and heavy models that are difficult to manipulate, explore and exploit.
     *  Moreover, considering the time dimension implies a quick increase of the
     *  size of the models, making them impossible to handle as a single and
     *  monolithic object.
     *
     *  The Eratosthene Project is designed to provide a solution by considering
     *  a space-time indexation formalism. This indexation formalism is used to
     *  implement a server able to manage, store and broadcast over the network
     *  very large 4D models distributed all over the earth surface and covering
     *  large periods of time. In addition to the server, the Eratosthene
     *  Project also implements a graphical client able to communicate with the
     *  remote servers to offer a convenient way to browse the models in both
     *  space and time.
     *
     *  The space-time indexation formalism is designed to efficiently manage
     *  the storage of the incoming 4D models and to offer a simple and
     *  efficient way of addressing queries to the server to allow models
     *  broadcasting. The space-time indexation also allows to perform queries
     *  to the server in an intuitive way giving the possibility to both address
     *  the challenge of the earth structures level of details and time
     *  management. This allows to explore the entire earth surface in terms of
     *  4D structures from large mountain chains in 2000 to very small details
     *  of cities in 1850.
     *
     *  The subsequent indexation formalism used to drive the storage and access
     *  of the data also naturally brings a standardised discretisation of space
     *  and time. Point-based models injected in the Eratosthene information
     *  system are then standardised from both spatial and temporal point of
     *  views. This allows the implementation of binary and logical operators
     *  when considering a model at two different times. The operators allow to
     *  deduce a third model on the fly providing a differential point of view
     *  of the two models separated in time. The evolution of cities and
     *  environments can be enhanced and analysed in an efficient way, opening
     *  the way to more advanced geographic services.
     *
     *  The ability of indexation formalism to consider polygonal models in
     *  addition to large scale point-based models allows to enhance the
     *  possibilities in terms of 4D geographic services. More than the
     *  possibility to automatically manage the polygonal models level of
     *  details and large scale display, the indexation formalism also allows
     *  compositions on the fly of mixed models allowing to compare different
     *  type of models, from lidar point-based models to land registers.
